### Machine Learning Notes

The common popular resources of introductory Machine Learning that people favor to use, normally stress one aspect of ML practice: either implementation (where derivation and math principles behind these methods are skipped, which might leave interested readers unsatisfied) or statistical theory (where implementation details might be hidden inside packages or discussed too little).

I've created this document on machine learning to summarize the essential both aspects on theory and code implementation, in order to boost my own understanding.
